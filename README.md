# Company-Financial-Analysis
Analysis of financial records 

In this task, create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial
data called budget_data.csv. In your Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
